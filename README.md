# Wrapped Party

I wanted my Spotify Wrapped early for a Wrapped prediction party.  Calculates top artists, top songs, top albums, new artists, top artists all time, and a couple other fun facts.




## FYI

You will need to have used Last.FM to track your plays for at minimum the last year and a free last.fm API account.

Replace API key in lastfm_apirequest.py and last.fm username in lastfm_apirequest.py and spotify_analyzer.py before executing.

#### packages
requests, json, time, tqdm, pandas, datetime, os



## Deployment

To run

```python
  cd \path\to\project\
  python .\lastfm_apirequest.py
  python .\spotify_analyzer.py
```
